## Which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the most convenient to liveï¼Ÿ 
Our goal is to determine the most convenient neighborhood to live in Pittsburgh by analyzing various metrics such as Walk Score, crime rate, and a combined analysis of education level, greening degree, and infrastructure quality.  After thoroughly examining the data and drawing from our own experiences, we have concluded that North Squirrel Hill is the winner.
